<h2>### Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h2>

<p>I'm a little experienced beginner in coding...</p>

<p>I started coding with 'processing' and i love 'Algorithmic Art'...<br>
At the moment i found a 'coding home' in P5.js, HTML and CSS...<br>
I'm right at the beginning but i love coding, cause it teaches me structure,<br>
it gives me focus, what it needs to reach a goal...</p>

<p>At the moment i work on a simple tool to create nice pieces of art
by using simple shapes...</p>

<p>- <b>thanks</b> to all the people out there, who share there knowledge and inspiration, you already helped me so much...</p>
