### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a little experienced beginner in coding...

I started coding with 'processing' and i love 'Algorithmic Art'...
At the moment i found a 'coding home' in P5.js, HTML and CSS...
I'm right at the beginning but i love coding, cause it teaches me structure, it gives me focus, what it needs to reach a goal...

At the moment i work on a simple tool to create nice pieces of art
by using simple shapes...

- thanks to all the people out there, who share there knowledge and inspiration, you already helped me so much...
